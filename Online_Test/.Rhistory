#1. As discussed in class, when considering the birthweight,
# we are concern with low birthweight. Which of the following
# models is more suitable for that?
#a) model.a <- glm(weight ~ ., data = DATA)
model.a <- glm(weight ~ ., data = DATA)
#b) model.b <- rq(weight ~ ., tau = 0.5, data = DATA)
model.b <- rq(weight ~ ., tau = 0.5, data = DATA)
#c) model.c <- rq(weight ~ ., tau = 0.1, data = DATA)
model.c <- rq(weight ~ ., tau = 0.1, data = DATA)
#d) model.d <- rq(weight ~ ., tau = 0.9, data = DATA)
model.d <- rq(weight ~ ., tau = 0.9, data = DATA)
# .means all the other variables
#b) model.b <- rq(weight ~ ., tau = 0.5, data = DATA)
model.b <- rq(weight ~ ., tau = 0.5, data = DATA)
#2. A pregnant patient came to the doctor's office concerned with the child. Although she is not gaining weight she is considering to keep smoking.
# In order to convince the mother to quit smoking, an appropriate regression model
# and interpretation was told the patient. Which of the following options would the medical provider argue to convince her?
#a) Based on
summary(model.a)$coef["smoke",]
# I am confident that by quitting smoking now you can increase the child's weight on average by 166g.
# This gain can help the child considerably.
#b) Looking at the tail is important to see the extreme impact smoking can have. Based on
summary(model.c)$coef["smoke",]
# I am confident that by quitting smoking now you can increase the child's weight on average by 166g.
# This gain can help the child considerably.
#b) Looking at the tail is important to see the extreme impact smoking can have. Based on
summary(model.c)$coef["smoke",]
## .means all the other variables
#b) model.b <- rq(weight ~ ., tau = 0.5, data = DATA)
model.b <- rq(weight ~ ., tau = 0.5, data = DATA)
#c) model.c <- rq(weight ~ ., tau = 0.1, data = DATA)
model.c <- rq(weight ~ ., tau = 0.1, data = DATA)
#d) model.d <- rq(weight ~ ., tau = 0.9, data = DATA)
model.d <- rq(weight ~ ., tau = 0.9, data = DATA)
# I am confident that by quitting smoking now you can increase the child's weight on average by 166g.
# This gain can help the child considerably.
#b) Looking at the tail is important to see the extreme impact smoking can have. Based on
summary(model.c)$coef["smoke",]
# I am confident that by quitting smoking now it can increase your child's weight by 176g which
# can  clinically help the cihld.
#c) Based on
summary(model.c)$coef["smoke",]
summary(model.c)$coef["cigsper",]
# I recommend you to simply reduce smoking by 5 cigarettes per day since the impact is roughly the same as not smoking.
#d) Based on
summary(model.b)$coef["smoke",]
summary(model.c)$coef["smoke",]
summary(model.d)$coef["smoke",]
#3. To further provide guidance to patients, the medical provider decided to construct a prediction interval
# for the birthweight. Consider a patient which has the same attribute values as observation number 2922,
patient <- DATA[2922,]
patient
# Which interval below would be a valid 80% prediction interval?
#(a)
quantile(DATA$weight, probs=c(.1,.9))
#
#(b)
c( lower = predict(model.c, newdata=patient),
upper = predict(model.d, newdata=patient) )
result_interactions <- glm(weight ~ (.)*smoke, data = DATA)

#If we are concerned with the interactions that are related to smoking,
#how many of the interactions are statistically significant .05 level using the conservative rule
#to account for multiple testing? Furthermore, does
summary(result_interactions)$coef["ed.col:smoke",]
#a) Accounting for multiple testing the number of significant variables is
